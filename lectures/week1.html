<h2 id="orientation">Orientation</h2>

<p>Learn about the course to help you determine if this is the right class for you. Take a look at the <a href="/outline">course outline</a></p>

<h3 id="outline">Outline</h3>

<p>A week-by-week breakdown of what we will learn, homework and other deliverables</p>

<h3 id="student-pages">Student Pages</h3>

<p>Each student will get personal webspace. This is not a continuation of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments, group work and more. Make it a site that is usable and functional.</p>

<p>Each student will be assigned web space for their homework and other files. All work performed on lab computers should be saved to personal files.</p>

<p>Your instructor will create webspaces for each student at the end of the first lecture. Please be present for this, as you will be entering your own password.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>Today, there are a lot of tools in Web Development, many of them are free with a few that have a cost that needs to be judged by how much you will use the tool.</p>

<h3 id="your-tools">Your Tools</h3>

<p>What kind of tools are you using to do your web development? These can be anything from editors to image editors, services for testing browser deployments, language linters, and more.</p>

<p>Some of the tools used by web developers…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are your tools?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="browser-based-tools">Browser-based tools</h3>

<p>Today, most modern browsers have some kind of development environment that can be turned on or triggered. Extra functions are available by plug-in or extension.</p>

<p>All browsers have a development environment today, with two primary platforms giving insight to developers through a suite of tools.</p>

<h4 id="firefox">Firefox</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Mozilla Foundation’s web platform created by web developers</li>
  <li>Gecko rendering engine: fast and progressive</li>
  <li>Excellent level of standards compliance</li>
  <li>Corporate independence</li>
  <li>No built-in development tools</li>
  <li>Plethora of add-ons that make web development easy</li>
  <li>Add-ons have a downside: bloat</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="webkit">WebKit</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This is the platform that gives us Chrome, Safari and Opera, with a few other smaller browsers out there as well.</li>
  <li>Excellent platform that is very fast and standards compliant</li>
  <li>Third parties can download the source, make local adjustments and release their own version, as Google and Apple have both done</li>
  <li>Standalone version can be downloaded at any time for the latest release</li>
  <li>Development is done via the built-in Developer Tools</li>
  <li>Initially a thin environment, recent releases have made Webkit-based browsers excellent for developers</li>
  <li>Macintosh based developers may need to enable web developer options in Safari before accessing the devloper tools</li>
  <li>Mobile and device-specific development also available</li>
  <li>Remember to test in as many browsers as you can!</li>
</ul>

<p>Useful tools for this are <a href="http://browsershots.org">BrowserShots</a> (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera) and <a href="http://netrenderer.com">Netrenderer</a> (For IE)</p>

<h3 id="firefox-extensions">Firefox Extensions</h3>

<p>Extensions are a big part of Firefox, especially considering the background the browser has in web development.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/web-development/">Web Development</a> even has it’s own category at the Firefox Add-Ons site.</p>

<p>One of the best tools for Web Developers is the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Web Developer toolbar</a></p>

<p>While there are fantastic tools built into each browser, the Web Developer Toolbar proves useful often and is worth having in your portfolio.</p>

<p>Some of the amazing tools this has to offer web developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disable styles - by embedded/linked/inline as well as all styles, or just a single sheet</li>
  <li>Edit CSS &amp; HTML - Make live changes to your CSS or HTML!</li>
  <li>Images - outlining, file sizes, alt information… lots more</li>
  <li>Form detail - useful for working with form elements</li>
  <li>Cookie examination and manipulation</li>
  <li>Built in validators</li>
  <li>Line Guides &amp; Rulers</li>
  <li>Element inspector</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s take a quick look at the Web Developer Toolbar</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/web-developer/">Install the Web Developer Toolbar in Firefox</a> if you have not already done so</li>
  <li>Examine the page using the Information tab, display various items on the page</li>
  <li>Use the Element Information tool (Information &gt; Display Element Information) and click on various items on the page</li>
  <li>Validate your page with the Tools tab (Tools &gt; Validate HTML)</li>
  <li>Edit the CSS of the page, or just add some new CSS (CSS &gt; Edit CSS)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="browser-based-diagnostic-tools">Browser Based Diagnostic Tools</h3>

<p>Like the Web Developer toolbar, this next extension also allows you to work with your web pages, albeit in a very different way.</p>

<p>As we get more complex, the harder it can be to figure out what is going on or what we got right or wrong.</p>

<p>Having a diagnostic tool to assist in developing will make it easier to examine every detail of your web page.</p>

<p>It goes beyond outlining, examining and editing into deep troubleshooting of network, javascript and even XHR (XMLHttpRequest)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Diagnostic Tool: <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firefox Firebug</a> (Add-on)</li>
  <li>Diagnostic Tool: Firefox (Built-In)</li>
  <li>Diagnostic Tool: Chrome (Built-In)</li>
  <li>Diagnostic Tool: Safari (Built-In)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a look at Firebug and what it can do!</p>

<p>Get familiar with using Firebug or similar tools. You will be required to use them in the classes ahead.</p>

<h3 id="developer-tools-wrap-up">Developer Tools Wrap up</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Firefox was the first browser to have real tools embedded and, with extensions, it’s a real powerhouse now</li>
  <li>The last few years have seen a constant progression of improved tools in other browsers, bringing everything up a significant notch</li>
  <li>Not a bad idea to have a “dev browser” that can be weighted down with tools</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at what Stadards are, what the point is and why they can benefit us or cause sadness later.</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<p><em>Web standards are the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe aspects of the World Wide Web.</em></p>

<h4 id="real-life-examples">Real life examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Lightbulbs</li>
  <li>Grades of gasoline</li>
  <li>Train rail widths</li>
  <li>TV Broadcast signals</li>
  <li>Home appliances</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-use-them">Why use them?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Interoperability</li>
  <li>Predictable results/dimensions/values</li>
  <li>A new specification is not needed for each new manufacturing run</li>
  <li>Need a new microwave? You can count on:
    <ul>
      <li>Plug/Voltage/Power</li>
      <li>Unit size</li>
      <li>Operation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-standards">Web Standards</h3>

<p>When you build without standards, you are investing in the here and now, without thinking of tomorrow.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code can be hard to support</li>
  <li>Future developers may be confused</li>
  <li>Re-engineering websites can be very difficult, costly and time consuming</li>
  <li>Most important Content is fused to your markup!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards-history-toward-the-web">Standards: History toward the Web</h2>

<h3 id="iso">ISO</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.iso.org">International Organization for Standards</a></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1906:</strong> As the Intn’l Electrotechnical Commission (IEC): in order to better access pre-determined equipment that was interchangeable and interoperable</li>
  <li><strong>1947:</strong> 25 countries got together to form ISO: “to facilitate the international coordination and unification of industrial standards”</li>
  <li>Companies agree to become a part of ISO, and gain access to the complete library of standards set by the organization in concert with their many members</li>
  <li>While it started slowly, many companies ignored standards, in favor of their own “proprietary” methods</li>
  <li>Momentum, corporate marketing (companies advertising that their product or method conforms with ISO XXXX), and some government legislation (forcing the adoption of certain standards) led to a larger adoption of standards</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/standards">W3C: World Wide Web Consortium</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Web standards are going through the same process that the ISO went through</li>
  <li>Many companies see the benefits of interoperability - many are still “forging their own”</li>
  <li>Many companies have standards: Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Ford, GM</li>
  <li>Many are proprietary standards, and are not supported by many companies</li>
  <li>W3C - World Wide Web Consortium: founded by Tim Berners-Lee to try and uniformly put forward standards through a single communication vehicle</li>
  <li>Leading browser makers did not follow, initially</li>
  <li>Designers were ‘taking sides’ in the browser wars: users were losers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="w3c-goals">W3C Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Universal Access</strong>: To make the Web accessible to all by promoting technologies that take into account the vast differences in culture, languages, education, ability, material resources, access devices, and physical limitations of users on all continents;</li>
  <li><strong>Semantic Web</strong>: To develop a software environment that permits each user to make the best use of the resources available on the Web;</li>
  <li><strong>Web of Trust</strong>: To guide the Web’s development with careful consideration for the novel legal, commercial, and social issues raised by this technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-progress">Making Progress</h3>

<p>Eventually, the drive towards standards began to win out</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users made their voices known and momentum started to slowly shift toward supporting standards</li>
  <li>Seen as a marketing opportunity: Our browser supports standards!</li>
  <li>Mozilla Project emerged after a large number of Netscape developers were let go upon the acquisition by AOL</li>
  <li>Mozilla is now a standards-compliant browser with many features</li>
  <li>Microsoft and AOL followed shortly with adoption of W3C standards (with limitations)</li>
  <li>Large companies started joining the W3C to be seen as part of the Standards game</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-web-developers">For Web Developers</h3>

<p>Designing to current W3C specifications means that:</p>

<p><em>Your pages will be viewable in the largest number of browsers, the largest number of devices and (if used correctly) will gracefully degrade as support for CSS or other presentation layers are absent.</em></p>

<p>Some more words from the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/faq/">Web Standards Project</a> worth reading</p>

<h2 id="details-of-standards-driven-development">Details of Standards-Driven Development</h2>

<p>Standard HTML + CSS + JS = Front-end Development = Best support</p>

<p>When you use standards-based development, you have the best chance to see your content displayed appropriately across the largest number of browsers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Structurally valid HTML code (eg: tags that open are closed. parent-child tag relationships are valid, etc)</li>
  <li>Logically valid HTML code (eg: ids are not applied more than once per page)</li>
  <li>Use CSS to develop sites that separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)</li>
  <li>Getting rid of deprecated tags, complex table layouts, browser sniffing, code forking</li>
  <li>Using Semantic Markup to establish content relationships and logical deployment of content</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future-compatibility">Future Compatibility</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Code is easier to use for future developers</li>
  <li>Less presentational HTML means easier design changes</li>
  <li>Keep the same code for longer periods of time</li>
  <li>Optimally, never change your code (if all presentation is gone)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reduced-development-costs">Reduced Development Costs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shorter development times for style changes</li>
  <li>CSS based layouts are easier to redesign, superior to HTML table layouts</li>
  <li>Easier to integrate with CMS (Content Management System) tools</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="special-needs">Special Needs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML lends itself to assistive readers (low vision, etc)</li>
  <li>Can support multiple stylesheets for different user needs</li>
  <li>An eye-opening exercise: try browsing with Webbie, a browser for the blind</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="single-codebase">Single Codebase</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No complex sniffing scripts</li>
  <li>Avoid having to support multiple browsers with multiple home/site pages (code forking)</li>
  <li>Much less upkeep (only one source to update)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Making the most of the elements you have control over</li>
  <li>jQuery ease of use! The better your HTML elements, classes and IDs, the easier it will be to access using jQuery</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards-development">Standards Development</h2>

<p>There are a few things that bear remembering…</p>

<h3 id="file-names">File names</h3>

<ul>
  <li>file and folder names should never contain
    <ul>
      <li>capital letters</li>
      <li>spaces, or;</li>
      <li>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>special characters such as ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) + { } [ ] : ; “ &lt; &gt; ?</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>acceptable non-alphanumeric characters: . _ - ~</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="auto-render-pages">Auto-render pages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>simple default page: <strong>index.htm</strong>, <strong>index.html</strong> or <strong>index.shtml</strong> (or whatever your server default is)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="file-management">File management</h3>

<ul>
  <li>including an index.html file in every folder on your server will ensure users cannot go snooping around your filesystem</li>
  <li>the index.html file can be a blank HTML page if you like, as long as the user does not see a list of files when they request a folder
    <ul>
      <li>Tip: Unix-style system developers can just use:</li>
      <li><em>touch index.html</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="browser-caching">Browser caching</h3>

<p>Browser caching can reduce excessive request/response transactions between client and server. However, some browsers may cache things like the CSS, so if the styles have changed since caching the client may not get the latest styles.
Shift + Reload, or Ctrl + F5 (Cmd + F5 for Mac) will force a page reload, but what if you users don’t think to do so?</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if a file name has changed, the browser will have to make a new request from the server. Versioning your file names will ensure users always have the latest version of any file (for example styles_1.0.css, styles_1.1.css, styles_1.2.css, styles_2.0.css etc)</li>
  <li>Query strings for CSS can also help to defeat caching as this will force a new load: styles.css?v1.2</li>
  <li>if there are files/pages on your server no longer being used, be sure to either remove them or locate them in a place where users are not going to accidentally find them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="semantic-markup">Semantic Markup</h2>

<p>As important as Standards-based development, Semantics played a huge part in the development of HTML5 and are here to stay.</p>

<p>They can also play a big part in your site being indexed successfully by some of the largest search engines out there.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-semantic-markup">What is Semantic Markup?</h3>

<p>Semantic markup is using the best tags that describe your content appropriately, and arranging your content in a hierarchy to group content together logically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice of organizing your content into a hierarchy</li>
  <li>Using appropriate tags for the content</li>
  <li>H1 … 6 tags for summary headings</li>
  <li>UL tags for unsorted, unranked, related points</li>
  <li>OL tags for sorted, ranked, related points</li>
  <li>Paragraph tags instead of double BR tags</li>
  <li>CSS instead of FONT</li>
  <li>HTML tables used for semantic value (tabular data), not for layouts</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Key Concept: Separate Content (HTML) from Presentation (CSS)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="building-content-relationships">Building Content Relationships</h3>

<p>Use appropriate tags for headings, content, sub-content, and lists, as this builds a relationship that descends from the title of the page.</p>

<p>Each group of content is a discrete piece of information bounded by headings, which relate to following paragraphs.</p>

<h3 id="logical-vs-physical-styles">Logical vs. Physical Styles</h3>

<p>The difference between logical and physical styles is hard to see. They display identically in browsers, but are fundamentally different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Key concept: Physical styles define what content looks like, logical styles define what content is</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Logical styles are important for screen readers, physical styles are not</li>
  <li>Given a choice, logical styles are usually preferred</li>
  <li>Some <strong>physical</strong> styles:
    <ul>
      <li>b - Bold</li>
      <li>i - Italic</li>
      <li>s - Strikethrough</li>
      <li>u - Underline</li>
      <li>font tags</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="logical-styling">Logical Styling</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Best way to markup content for long-term usage</li>
  <li>Use CSS to change style (and some behaviour)</li>
  <li>Use JS to change behaviour</li>
  <li>Some logical styles:
    <ul>
      <li>code - Code sample</li>
      <li>kbd - Keyboard entry</li>
      <li>samp - Programming sample</li>
      <li>var - Variable</li>
      <li>cite - Citation</li>
      <li>dfn - Definition</li>
      <li>abbr - Abbreviation</li>
      <li>acronym - Acronym</li>
      <li>del - Deleted text</li>
      <li>ins - Inserted text</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="key-advantages">Key Advantages</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Extracting important pieces of information is simple (CITE or CODE tags for example)</li>
  <li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
  <li>Big win for jQuery</li>
  <li>RSS readers scraping content</li>
  <li>In-browser “focus” applications</li>
  <li>Assistive Screen reader friendly</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>While there is plenty of individual homework to do, there will be several team oriented exercises in this class. Be sure to build pages you are proud of, and be ready and willing to share the them with your colleagues.</p>

<p>All COMP1950 students must verify they are capable of connecting to their course webspace via FTP. Students are expected to be fluent with the use of FTP, so be sure to remember your connectivity information.</p>

<p>Reminder: <a href="/studentpages">Details on Student Pages</a></p>

<h2 id="comp1950-best-practices">COMP1950 Best Practices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Get acquainted with a browser based developer tool(s). they are crucial to making your development more efficient and effective.</li>
  <li>Suggestion is Firefox, but Chrome, Safari are also great tools. IE development tools are not as well known, use at your own risk.</li>
  <li>Practice standards based development at all times:
    <ul>
      <li>encourage user trust by building pages that are coherent and well presented</li>
      <li>facilitate accessibility options for the disabled</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>HTML</strong>: used for describing the semantics and structure of page content</li>
  <li><strong>CSS</strong>: used for applying presentation rules (colors, fonts, content location/position)</li>
  <li><strong>Javascript</strong>: enables page behavior, response to user interactions
recognize that only structuraly valid code can be expected to operate predictably</li>
  <li><a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3C HTML validator</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS validator</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There will be challenges in class as well as open and closed book quizzes.</p>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

<p>Homework will <em>ALWAYS</em> be due at 12:00pm Noon the day before the next class.  For those who are challenged by calendars, this means that you must have your homework uploaded to your Student Page by Noon on Mondays.</p>

<p>If you do not have your homework up in time, it will be marked as incomplete and you will receive no feedback.  However, you are encouraged to complete your homework anyway, as you will receive a mark at the end of the term for the entirety of your assignments.</p>
