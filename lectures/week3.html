<h3 id="robots">Robots</h3>

<p>What is a robot, in the context of web development?  It’s a user agent designed to index the web, either to store the results, or look for specific results.</p>

<p>You can control the robots! There are many declarations you can use to control the behaviour of robots. <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062596">Google has good resources for robots.txt files</a>.</p>

<p>I use a robots.txt file for the site, as you can see here: <a href="/robots.txt">My robots.txt file</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s plain text and can be viewed at any site that uses it</li>
  <li>User agenst don’t have to follow the rules</li>
  <li>Always a good idea to have one</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="humans">Humans</h3>

<p>There is a similar system set up for recognizing people that have worked on a project. It’s called humans.txt and can be a great way to recognize members of a team, and to claim credit for work you have done.</p>

<p>Find <a href="http://humanstxt.org/">more information at the humanstxt.org</a> site.</p>

<p>You can see <a href="/humans.txt">my humans.txt file</a> as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not searched as much as the robots.txt file</li>
  <li>good to use in tandem with a meta tag</li>
  <li>great way to get credit without having to add it on the site itself</li>
  <li>A kind of “proof” you worked on the site</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reminder-css-reset">Reminder: CSS Reset</h3>

<p>We talked very briefly about CSS Resets last week.</p>

<p>They are there to reset your CSS to a baseline amount so that your elements display in a predictable manner. That way, all styling on top is also predictable.</p>

<p>They <strong>must be referenced first</strong> for them to work effectively due to the way CSS reads, computes and applies rules.</p>

<h3 id="reminder-referer">Reminder: Referer</h3>

<p>Last week we also discussed how to create a link to the W3C Validator using what is called a “referer” in the query string.  It looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer</code></pre></figure>

<p>The main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is one URL that can be used anywhere</li>
  <li>It tells the validator: “Validate the page that I came from”</li>
  <li>No requirement to hard-code a URL (which can never be re-used outside the page it is on)</li>
  <li>Prevents errors when re-using hard-coded URLs on other pages</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reminder-seo">Reminder: SEO</h3>

<p>Using some of the methods we talked about last week can really help to improve your sites and how they are indexed.  There are two easy-to-implement ideas that I shared last week that very few of you did:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Description meta tag</strong>: This is a very easy option to implement that you should be using as often as you can. This course is good practice.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"description"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"Add your description here, it will be used for your search result detail"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creating easy URLs</strong>: Suprisingly no one did this (as far as I remember). Creating the folders that create a structure with the pages you had to work with makes the construction of your site easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commenting-your-code">Commenting your code</h3>

<p>Some of the best ways for you to learn is from others.  The web was developed largely by people who used View &gt; Source in the earliest of days.</p>

<p class="message">All HTML, CSS and JS is totally viewable on any website, anywhere.</p>

<p>You should be viewing code <em>all the time</em> to see how others do it.</p>

<p>The best web developers do this <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<p>So, if <strong>you</strong> are viewing code, you can bet that <strong>they</strong> are viewing code too, including yours!</p>

<p>Commenting your code will help other developers and yourself to figure out what you did, when, how, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commented code doesn’t have to go into production - strip it with various tools</li>
  <li>For your own (and your teams) development, it can be invaluable</li>
  <li>Don’t be too verbose. Add tags only where necessary</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="good">Good</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some Content<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span><span class="c">&lt;!-- /.foo --&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some Content<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span><span class="c">&lt;!-- /#bar --&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this example it looks uninspiring, but in a document that is 3000 lines long, it’s nice to know what that closing div tag does.</p>

<h4 id="not-good">Not Good</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;footer&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some Content<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/footer&gt;</span><span class="c">&lt;!-- /footer -&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="one-html-many-css">One HTML, Many CSS</h2>

<p>I have mentioned many times in class: Separate your Content from your Presentation.  One of the main reasons for this is the ability to apply different styles to your content.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to do this, but the primary ones are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can use different presentation options (CSS) on the same content (HTML)</li>
  <li>You can target different platforms (devices) in different ways</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternate-sheets">Alternate sheets</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To specify an alternate stylesheet, use: <code class="inline">rel="alternate stylesheet"</code> within the link element:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"alternate stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"styles.css"</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">"screen"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Main Styles"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Tip: If you have multiple sheets that belong to one “look” make sure they all have the same title name</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>An example would be to create a ‘Larger Text’ style sheet with everything in a larger font, or an alternate sheet for a special event</li>
  <li>Made famous by <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="print-styles">Print Styles</h3>

<p>One of the areas of the web that is under represented is Print Style Sheets. They work just like a normal stylesheet, but you have much less display opportunity than a screen-based device.</p>

<p>Take a look at this page on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/breaking-up-large-files-into-sections/">Breaking up large files</a> from CSS Tricks.</p>

<p>Compare the screen version versus the print version. Notice the elements that are present and the ones that aren’t. The easiest way to view the printed version is clicking <strong>File &gt; Print Preview</strong> on a PC or <strong>File &gt; Print</strong> on a Mac and select Open PDF in Preview from the PDF menu.</p>

<p>Mostly, look at how the information is presented that takes advantage of the likely destination format: paper.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-create-a-print-stylesheet">Exercise: Create a Print Stylesheet</h3>

<p>Take last week’s homework and work with your HTML to create a new stylesheet targeted at print.</p>

<p>You may need to re-factor some of your HTML in order to work properly, which might have a repercussion on the styles you created from last week.</p>

<p>Welcome to modern web development!</p>

<p><a href="printstylesheet.html">Let’s get started on the exercise</a></p>

<h2 id="same-content-different-presentation">Same Content, Different Presentation</h2>

<p>This is the concept behind responsive: same code, different presentation.</p>

<h3 id="using-import-and-media">Using @import and @media</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In your code and stylesheets, you can call other stylesheets with @import</li>
  <li>A great place to be able to manage your CSS, by using @import to create a “CSS Loader” page</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>

<p>To use a CSS Loader, from your main document:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">  <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"styles.css"</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">"screen"</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">"Main Styles"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, in the body of the styles.css file, import as many files as you need:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="k">@import</span> <span class="sx">url(type.css)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@import</span> <span class="sx">url(nav.css)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@import</span> <span class="sx">url(template.css)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">{</span><span class="err">Any</span> <span class="err">other</span> <span class="err">CSS</span> <span class="err">Styles</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="css-positioning">CSS Positioning</h2>

<p>Building proper CSS-based layouts requires an understanding of how positioning works, which is based largely on the <strong><a href="box-model.png">Box Model</a></strong> concept.</p>

<p>Box model math is where almost all layouts fail.  Content = width in default model.</p>

<h3 id="box-model-basics">Box model basics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>All elements are built around the concept of a box</li>
  <li><em>Every</em> element is contained in a Box of some sort or another</li>
  <li>Each element has a content at it’s core, surrounded by padding, borders, margins</li>
  <li>Both inline and block-level elements having these properties</li>
  <li>Width refers to left inner edge to the right inner edge of content</li>
  <li>Height refers to the top inner edge to the bottom inner edge of content</li>
  <li>Additionally, margins will collapse vertically, but not horizontally</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="basic-example">Basic example</h3>

<p>A <strong>paragraph</strong> inside a <strong>div#wrap</strong> which is, in turn contained inside the <strong>body</strong> element.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measurements need to include padding, border and margin for math to work</li>
  <li>Relative measurements can be problematic due to their inheritance</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy so far, right?</p>

<p>When it comes to layouts, you can now use the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">html</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">box-sizing</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">border-box</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">*,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nd">:before</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">box-sizing</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">inherit</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What does this do?</p>

<h2 id="positioning-details">Positioning Details</h2>

<p>There are a few terms worth knowing….</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Normal Flow</strong> - these are generally text that ‘flows’ from left
 to right (in Western society). Normal flow is the default scheme with block elements flowing from the top downwards. Inline elements flow left to right. Normal
 flow also sees your vertical margins collapsing. Only the larger of the two margins are used when calculating distance between the two.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-replaced element</strong> - these elements are actually contained inside the document.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example</em>: a paragraph of text.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Replaced element</strong> - these are not actually contained in the document, but are linked to.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Example</em>: an img or input tag</p>

<h3 id="floating-and-positioning">Floating and Positioning</h3>

<p>In order to have your content show in an appropriate location, you may need to either float or position your containers.</p>

<p>Positioning is fairly strightforward and has been around for a long time. Declare exactly where an element box will appear compared to where it would normally be.</p>

<h3 id="positioning-states">4 positioning states:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Static</strong>: Generated as normal</li>
  <li><strong>Relative</strong>: The box is offset by some distance</li>
  <li><strong>Absolute</strong>: The box is no longer part of the flow of the document and is placed with respect to its containing block.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Similar to absolute, but it is attached to a specific location</li>
</ul>

<p>Floating was introduced in CSS1 and gives rise to a lot of difficulties for many
users.</p>

<p>Similar to &lt;img src=”img.gif” align=”right”&gt; which ‘floats’ the image to the right of the content, and other content will float around floated elements.</p>

<p>Consecutive floats (with similar alignment like right or left) will attempt to float using the same top-line, but will collapse to another line if space does not permit</p>

<p>Remember! Consecutive right floats will appear in reverse order on the final render.</p>

<p>To make sure elements don’t fall into a floated element, you can use the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css">	<span class="nc">.example</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">clear</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also use <strong>right</strong> and <strong>both</strong> as arguments.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>

<p><a href="positioning">A walkthrough of some positioning scenarios</a></p>

<h2 id="layout-basics">Layout Basics</h2>

<p>In order to lay out content on the screen, there needs to be a container that you can place your content into. Often this is the <strong>body</strong> element.</p>

<p>For a <a href="http://codyhouse.co/gem/custom-google-map/">single column, vertical stack</a>, this is fairly easy: just place all the content in the container. Single page stacks are becoming very common.</p>

<p>For more complex layouts, (more than 1 column), you will need to create a container to hold your different content areas.</p>

<p>DIV elements are best for this, because they contain no semantics and can easily be used in your code.</p>

<p>They can be floated, or positioned in any way. Similarly, elements within those divs can also be positioned relatively or absolutely</p>

<h2 id="media-queries">Media Queries</h2>

<p>Media Queries are the basis of Responsive Web Design and are a simple tweak of style sheet media declarations.</p>

<p>The ability to target specific device widths and orientations has made it possible to create “Responsive” web designs. Ethan Marcotte wrote one of the very first articles on Responsive Web Design in 2010, and the idea has taken off since then.</p>

<p>The concept is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use @media declarations to target device size and/or orientation using CSS</li>
  <li>Because you have already created print stylesheets, you’ve used the concept!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s fundamentally the same idea, but instead of targeting a specific type of media, you will be targeting a specific size.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Media Query: @media TYPE (FEATURE: VALUE) { CSS rules go here }</li>
  <li>Type: Target media type, mostly screen</li>
  <li>Feature: There are a number of features that can be targeted, including:
    <ul>
      <li>width: width of the viewport</li>
      <li>height: height of the viewport</li>
      <li>device-width: width of the device</li>
      <li>device-height: height of the device</li>
      <li>orientation: landscape or portrait</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Value: the corresponding value such as size in pixels or other specifications like landscape</li>
</ul>

<p>Media queries can be specified in the head of a document (embedded) or they can be linked to like any other stylesheet, which will contain the queries themselves.</p>

<p>Media queries can also be specified in the LINK tag itself, like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"smaller.css"</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">"screen and (max-width: 1024px)"</span>
 <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"larger.css"</span> <span class="na">media=</span><span class="s">"screen and (min-width: 1024px)"</span> 
<span class="nt">/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, some devices have been designed to display higher resolution pages in a smaller area. This can cause confusion, and so a META tag was designed to get around this issue:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">	<span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"viewport"</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">"initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="how-do-they-work">How do they work?</h3>

<p>When the page is initially rendered, the user agent (browser) will assess the size of the viewport and select CSS based on any media query declarations. This is also true if the viewport is resized.</p>

<h3 id="fixed-vs-fluid">Fixed vs Fluid</h3>

<p>When looking at responsive designs, there is the decision to build Fixed vs Fluid designs.</p>

<p>Fixed are easier to control as you know the widths and don’t have to worry about overflowing elements, items that don’t fit from side to side, margin and padding calculations and more.</p>

<p>Fluid designs us percentage and em (relative) widths for things that allow you to build a style that will scale to ANY size of user agent</p>

<p>The Flexible Grid is the key to being successful for fluid designs. There are two primary drivers behind this method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>target / context = result</li>
  <li>max-width: 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>The first calculation relates to your measurements for widths, margins, padding and even font-size when building a fluid design.</p>

<p>How <strong>target / context = result</strong> works</p>

<p>Everything centers around the base font size.  Setting that for the body element will allow everything else to follow.</p>

<p>Let’s say you are interested in having a first-level heading appear as 20px in size.</p>

<p>If you assume that you have set your body {…} element as having a font-size of 16px, then we have the two required parts of our calculation:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">	target (20) / context (16) = 1.25</code></pre></figure>

<p>Take that 1.25 as a relative measurement based on the default 16px setting. Use it now as the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">font-family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Arial</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"Helvetica Neue"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">16px</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  
  <span class="c">/* target / context = result */</span>
  <span class="c">/* 20     / 16      = 1.25   */</span>
  
<span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.25em</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* This will render the font-size to the equivalent of 20px
 */</span>
  <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="image-widths">Image widths</h3>

<p>One of the biggest challenges to any responsive design is images</p>

<p>Most images want to display at full size, but this method means they may be displayed at multiple sizes, and issuing width=”…” and height=”…” attributes in your IMG tags makes it difficult to make this work.</p>

<p>In comes the <strong>max-width</strong> rule in your CSS</p>

<p>Using this rule, you are essentially saying that the image should always be 100% of the parent element</p>

<p>With either a fixed or fluid layout, you will have your images respect the parent element’s width, so you don’t have to add width attributes in your <strong>img</strong> tags.</p>

<h3 id="using-media-to-change-display">Using @media to change display</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at how we can use @media to change the display, in a very basic way just to get started. We will try to make it do something, and then apply that to your homework.</p>

<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>

<p>Last week, you did some epic homework combining a bunch of things. This week, with the long weekend approaching and the sun coming out, you have a lighter workload!</p>

<h3 id="brewery-page---next-version">Brewery Page - Next Version</h3>

<p>You will take your Brewery page and build it with an adaptive design that has 3 breakpoints in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1024px or larger</li>
  <li>360px or smaller</li>
  <li>361px - 1023px</li>
</ul>

<p>In each style, be sure to have a different layout and navigation scheme that makes sense for the different style.</p>

<p>Styles do not have to be fluid, but you can try it if you like. Fixed styles are fine so long as they work correctly for each size.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a device to test on, be sure to use the Firefox Developer Tools (Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Responsive Design View)</p>

<p>Remember to validate your page and have a link to the validator!</p>

<p>Homework is due EVERY MONDAY AT NOON.</p>
